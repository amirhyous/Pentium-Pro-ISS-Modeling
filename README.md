# ISA Modeling of Intel Pentium Pro Processor

## Overview of SystemC
SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros that provide an event-driven simulation environment. It is widely used for system-level modeling, enabling developers to simulate hardware and software components together.

## Intel Pentium Pro Processor
The Intel Pentium Pro is a high-performance microprocessor designed for server and workstation applications, introduced in 1995. It features a sophisticated architecture that includes a dynamic execution engine, out-of-order execution, and support for multiple instruction sets.

## Project Description
In this project, I modeled a subset of the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the Intel Pentium Pro Processor using C++ and the SystemC library. The implementation focuses on accurately simulating various instructions, demonstrating the capabilities and behavior of the processor architecture.

For detailed information and instructions, please refer to the [Project Report](Pentium Pro SystemC Implemantation Guid.pdf).
